# TensorFlow Learning
## Goal
Explore TensorFlow library by sampling code and picking it apart.  Will eventually construct my own machine learning exercises.

## Index
`hello_world.py` Quick check to make sure library was installed and running.  Multiplies two matrices.

`hello_train.py` More complex code involving keras and numpy for model training.

## hello_world.py
### Notes
- `tf.constant()` is used to instantiate a matrix
	- check tensor docs for parameters
- `tf.multiply()` called to run calculations on matrices
	- check tensor docs for parameters
